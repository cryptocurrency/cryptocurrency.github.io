When Bitcoin broke into public consciousness in 2013, it couldn’t have been hotter and more interesting: a digital currency that was being used to buy everything from drugs to intimate accessories. After that, the excitement shifted to a characteristic of Bitcoin that is somewhat less sexy: public online ledgers.

Blockchain — which is the technology that is used to verify and record transactions that are at the center of Bitcoin — is seen as having the potential to reshape the global financial system and possibly other industries. Both Bitcoin and its blockchain are gaining imitators as well as believers.

## The current situation

The price of Bitcoin went sky-hight in 2017 before giving up much of those gains, as the debate went on whether the cryptocurrency — whose total value neared $300 billion in its highest range — should be considered a legitimate financial asset. It got a huge boost when Cboe Global Markets Inc. started futures trading tied to the digital currency and CME Group Inc. and Nasdaq Inc, said they would follow suit.

Futures trading will push Bitcoin closer to the mainstream by making it easier to trade without the annoyances of owning it directly. Bitcoin started to look almost traditional compared with the new cryptocurrencies that raised more than $3.5 billion through initial coin offers.

Their exponential growth drew warnings from regulators around the globe even before hackers stole almost $500 million worth of the digital token called NEM from a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange. The Bitcoin community collaborated (more or less) in November to reject a proposed software change that had threatened with a split. In the meantime, more than 100 banks are working within the R3 consortium, which was created to find ways to use blockchain as a decentralized ledger to track money transfers and other transactions. Australia's stock exchange is planning to start using blockchain to process equity transactions. Blockchain is also being tested by retailers, for example Wal-Mart Stores Inc. for ensuring food safety, and industries are starting to explore what advantages the technology might hold over using traditional databases.

## How Blockchain works for bitcoin

Virtual currencies aren’t a new thing. Online fantasy games, for example, have long been using them. Nonetheless, the development of a secure digital currency without a central issuer rightly raised some interests. The enigmatic spikes and drops in the price of Bitcoin since its birth helped build an early reputation for the currency as a means for selling drugs and laundering money, among other illegal things. Its history has also been subjected to arrests for Ponzi schemes. The person or multiple persons who created the Bitcoin system under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto solved a problem central to any currency (which is preventing counterfeiting) and did it without relying on a government’s authority. The software also solved one specific hurdle for digital money — how to stop users from spending the same unit of currency twice. The breakthrough idea was blockchain, a publicly visible, anonymous online ledger that records every single Bitcoin transaction. It’s maintained by a network of “miners” whose computers perform the calculations that validate each transaction, preventing double-spending. They earn a reward of newly issued Bitcoin. The pace of creation is limited, and no more than 21 million will ever be issued.

Since Bitcoin first soared, there’s been no shortage of critics to call its rise a bubble and to argue that the currency has no intrinsic value. Entrepreneurs in the field say that focusing on the price of Bitcoin is missing the point — its value is as proof of concept for a new kind of payment system not reliant on third parties like governments, big banks or credit-card companies. Others say blockchain advocates are hyping what amounts to no more than a new kind of database. Proponents of ether, the second most commonly used digital currency, respond that the etherium blockchain does far more than let Bitcoin users send value from one person to another. Its advocates think it could be a universally accessible machine for running businesses, as the technology allows people to do more complex actions in a shared and decentralized manner.

## Blockchain and tech companies

Demand for the technology that is best known for supporting bitcoin, is growing so much that it will be one of the largest users of capacity next year at about 60 data centers that International Business Machines Corp. rents out to other companies around the globe. IBM was one of the first big companies to see blockchain’s promise, and contributed code to an open-source effort and encouraging startups to try the technology on its cloud for free. The fact that a 106-year-old company like IBM is going all in on blockchain shows just how far the digital ledger has come since its early days underpinning bitcoin drug deals on the dark web. The market for blockchain-related products and services will reach $7.7 billion in 2022, up from $242 million last year, according to researcher Markets & Markets.

That’s creating new prospects for some of the old players of the technology world, companies like IBM and Microsoft Corp. that are making the transition to cloud services. And products that had gone out of vogue, such as databases sold by Oracle Corp., are becoming hot again. Since multiple companies -- such as all parties take part in a supply chain -- can use the same blockchain, it’s encouraging IBM to revise the way it rewards sales associates. In the past years, sales reps got paid when their clients bought IBM technologies directly. However, now they will also receive a commission when clients encourage other companies to join them on a blockchain network and use Big Blue’s systems and services.  The blockchain enables companies doing business with each other to record transactions securely. Its strength is in its trustworthiness: it is difficult to reverse or change something that has been recorded. The blockchain can also hold more documents and data than traditional database storage, allowing for more nuanced insights and analysis. It can also hold embedded contracts, such as a lease for a car, whose virtual key could be transferred to a bank in the event of a default. In October last year, Oracle announced the formation of Oracle Blockchain Cloud Service. This entitiy helps customers extend existing applications like enterprise-resource management systems. A month earlier, rival SAP SE said clients in industries like manufacturing and supply chain were testing its cloud service. And on November 20, Microsoft expanded its partnership with consortium R3 to make it easier for financial institutions to deploy blockchains in its Azure cloud.

IBM, in the meantime, has been one of key companies behind the Hyperledger consortium, a nonprofit open-source project that aims to create efficient standards for commercial use of blockchain technology. IBM also offers companies a free trial of blockchain in its cloud. Almost six out of 10 large corporations are considering using blockchain, according to a survey of 400 executives, managers and tech staff that has been conducted by Juniper Research. The technology is gradually being tested or used by companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Visa Inc. to streamline supply chain, accelerate payments and store records. Deployments of blockchain should increase sales growth in cloud services, databases and servers by 35 percent, and, in five years, blockchain technology will push more than 55 percent of large companies with more than 1,000 employees to use the cloud instead of their own data centers.

## Advantages of blockchain

### 1. Transparency

One of the prime reasons blockchain is intriguing to businesses is that this technology is almost always open source. That means other users or developers have the opportunity to modify it as they see fit. But what's most important about it being open source is that it makes altering logged data within a blockchain incredibly difficult. This makes blockchain a particularly secure technology.

### 2. Reduced costs of transactions

Blockchain allows peer-to-peer and business-to-business transactions to be finalized without the need for a third party, which is often a bank. Since there's no middleman involvement tied to blockchain transactions, it means they can reduce costs to the user or businesses over time.

### 3. Transaction settlements are faster

When it comes to traditional banks, it's common for transactions to take days to completely settle. This is due to protocols in the bank’s transferring software, and the fact that financial institutions are only open during normal business hours, five days a week. You also have financial institutions located in various time zones around the world, which can delay processing times. Compare this to blockchain technology: it is operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, meaning blockchain-based transactions process considerably more quickly.

### 4. Decentralized nature

Another central reason blockchain is so interesting is its lack of a central data hub. Instead of running a massive data center and verifying transactions through it, blockchain actually allows individual transactions to have their own proof of validity and the authorization to enforce those constraints. This ensures that if this information fell into unwanted hands (i.e.: a cyber-criminal), only a small amount of data would be compromised, instead of the entire network.

### 5. User-controlled networks

Finally, cryptocurrency investors tend to be really encouraged by the control aspect of blockchain. Rather than having a third party run the show, users and developers are the ones who get to make the decisions. For instance, an inability to reach an 80% consensus on an upgrade tied to bitcoin's blockchain is what necessitated a fork into two separate currencies (bitcoin and bitcoin cash) more than four months ago. Having a say goes a long way with investors and developers.

## +1 A thing to worry about

However, the chief worry that we can’t overlook is that investors have, on multiple occasions, overestimated how quickly new technology will be adopted. Whether we're talking about internet-based business-to-business commerce, genome decoding, electric vehicles, 3D printing, and so on, none of these game-changers were immediate winners, despite investors sending the valuations of associated companies through the roof. It takes time to lay the groundwork for new technologies like blockchain, and it could be years before we see business adopt this technology as a major component of their payment networks.
